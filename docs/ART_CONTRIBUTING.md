# Welcome to Sunflower Land docs contributing guide

Thank you for joining our journey and helping us build the #1 Community Metaverse game

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow for getting your artwork in the game

### Disclaimer

By contributing to this repository you provide Sunflower Land the rights to use your work in the game indefintely. While we often reward open source developers with NFTs, contributing does not guarantee any sort of rewards from the game.

## How can I help?

If you have a bright idea, open an issue or join our active Discord #artists-chat first and start a discussion. We love to bring in the community ideas where possible!

Don't have any ideas? We would suggest scanning the open issues and seeing if there is something that catches your eye.

If you are looking for something to work on, the team manages an open list of art requests on Github you can check out - https://github.com/sunflower-land/sunflower-land/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22art+request%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc

## How do I submit the art work?

To help organize what art work the project needs, what is being voted on and what is accepted please upload your image as an attachment to the Github issue.

## How does the art get accepted?

The team is exploring DAO mechanisms and voting rights for people with certain NFTs. Until we have this automated system, artwork is picked by community consensus in Discord and on the Github issue.
